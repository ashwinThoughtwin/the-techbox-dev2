Use pip or easy_install, as you want

Bash
pip install coverage 
Running and erasing
For running on a django project, use this command

Bash
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test the-app-you-want-to-test
This command will fill a “.coverage”, located in COVERAGE_FILE and then you may see results or report. If you need to remove gathered data, execute:

Bash
coverage erase
For a single file
Maybe you only want to check a python code, then do

Bash
coverage run your_program.py arg1 arg2 arg3
There are some additional options, take a look on https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.3.4/cmd.html#execution

About templates, see the plugin section and install one of those eggs:

Django templates

Mako templates

See results
If you want to show the results in the command line, run:

Bash
coverage report
For more readable reports:

Bash
coverage html
To know concretely what part of your code is covered by tests, use:

Bash
coverage annotate -d directory-where-to-put-annotated-files
It will generate same source code file with an additional syntax on it:

Line with “>” means it was executed

Line beginning with “!” means it was not executed

Line starting with “-” means the line was excluded in the coverage statistics

Good coverage level
A good coverage usually comes on 90%. However, if you see 100% it could be not so good signal because it could be someone dealing with coverage instead of quality of tests.

Some tips:

Be careful with the quality of your tests

Don’t slow down your dev. velocity of the sake of the coverage

Use coverage to find untested code and decide if it deserve to cover

Excluding code
So far so good, however sometimes we need to exclude some code that we don’t need to cover. There are several options:

Specifying files to exclude and omit in .coveragerc

Writing in the same line of a block the comment

Python
 # pragma: no cover
For example, if you want to exclude generated code from coverage because it is suppossed to be maintained by the generation tool:

Python
def generated_code():   # pragma: no cover
   do_something()
